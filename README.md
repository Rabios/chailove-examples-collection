Awesome collection of [ChaiLove](https://www.libretro.com/index.php/chailove/) examples, For everyone!

Each example has link to it's original source, As examples are ports of their original source codes!

> NOTE 1: Few examples need [ChaiScript extras](https://github.com/ChaiScript/ChaiScript_extras), That's for math functions!

> NOTE 2: Not sure if more examples will be added but soon if i had time for this :(
